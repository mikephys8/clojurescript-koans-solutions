# clojurescript-koans-solutions

All solutions to the [Clojurescript Koans] (http://clojurescriptkoans.com/)

I have made some comments wherever I thought it would be needed, 
in case that someone doesn't understand something after he has read Clojure basics

> in [conj.io] (http://conj.io/)

> or in [clojuredocs] (https://clojuredocs.org/), 

> also check [braveclojure] (http://www.braveclojure.com/)


please do not hesitate to send me a message or if you find something wrong also.

*Have fun!!!*
